## Current Status
Phase: Agentic Retrieval Implementation with Specialized LLM Configuration

### Recent Architectural Decisions

1. **Agentic Retrieval System**
   - **Decision**: Implement a graph-based agentic workflow with specialized nodes
   - **Rationale**: Traditional chain-based approaches lack the flexibility and explicit state management needed for complex query handling
   - **Tradeoffs**: Increased architectural complexity for better separation of concerns and maintainability
   - **Benefits**: Clear reasoning paths, parallel processing capabilities, and specialized LLM selection

2. **Service Architecture**
   - **Decision**: Adopt interface-based design with factory pattern
   - **Rationale**: Decouple UI from implementation details and enable runtime configuration
   - **Tradeoffs**: Additional abstraction layer vs. implementation flexibility
   - **Benefits**: Simplified dependency management, testability, and future provider swapping

3. **LLM Configuration System**
   - **Decision**: Implement node-specific LLM selection
   - **Rationale**: Different reasoning tasks benefit from different model capabilities
   - **Tradeoffs**: Increased API calls and complexity vs. optimized performance and cost
   - **Benefits**: Cost optimization, performance tuning, and specialized reasoning capabilities

### Key Technical Tradeoffs

1. **Parallel Processing vs. Sequential Execution**
   - **Choice**: Parallel subquery processing with asyncio
   - **Tradeoff**: Increased memory usage vs. significantly reduced response time
   - **Mitigation**: Efficient error handling and state management to prevent resource leaks

2. **Specialized LLMs vs. Single Model**
   - **Choice**: Different LLMs for different reasoning tasks
   - **Tradeoff**: Increased API complexity vs. optimized performance and cost
   - **Mitigation**: Fallback mechanisms and configuration-based selection

3. **Enhanced State vs. Simple State**
   - **Choice**: Rich state model with subquery tracking
   - **Tradeoff**: Increased memory footprint vs. comprehensive tracking and error recovery
   - **Mitigation**: Efficient state serialization and cleanup

4. **Query Decomposition vs. Direct Processing**
   - **Choice**: Intelligent query decomposition for complex questions
   - **Tradeoff**: Additional LLM call overhead vs. more comprehensive answers
   - **Mitigation**: Complexity detection to bypass decomposition for simple queries

## Current Focus Areas
