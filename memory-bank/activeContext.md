## Current Status
Phase 2: Core Implementation (Data Pipeline Integration)

### Recent Updates
1. **Vector Store Migration**
   - Transitioned from OpenSearch to Upstash Vector
   - Implemented vector store factory with Upstash integration
   - Enhanced data storage and retrieval efficiency

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Implemented Data Stack in CDK
   - Created Lambda functions for data processing
   - Added Bedrock model access permissions
   - Integrated Upstash Vector for embeddings storage
   - Enhanced error handling and monitoring

3. **Architecture Improvements**
   - Streamlined stack organization
   - Enhanced error handling and logging
   - Improved security with IAM roles and policies

4. **Container Build System Update**
   - Added support for Finch as an alternative to Docker
   - Updated Dockerfiles and docker-compose files for both dev and prod environments
   - Implemented USE_FINCH build argument to control Finch usage
   - Set platform to linux/arm64 for improved compatibility

3. Test data processing pipeline
4. Update system documentation
5. Test and validate Finch-based builds in both dev and prod environments
6. Update CI/CD pipelines to support Finch (if applicable)
7. Document Finch usage in project README and developer guidelines

### Short Term
1. Optimize Lambda performance
2. Enhance monitoring and logging
3. Implement comprehensive testing
4. Fine-tune vector store operations
5. Integrate internet search tools
6. Implement agentic flow system
7. Implement prompt engineering improvements
8. Develop query rewriting system
