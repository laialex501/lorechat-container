## Current Status
Phase 2: Core Implementation (Data Pipeline Integration)

### Recent Updates
1. **Vector Store Migration**
   - Transitioned from OpenSearch to Upstash Vector
   - Implemented vector store factory with Upstash integration
   - Enhanced data storage and retrieval efficiency

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Implemented Data Stack in CDK
   - Created Lambda functions for data processing
   - Added Bedrock model access permissions
   - Integrated Upstash Vector for embeddings storage

3. **Architecture Improvements**
   - Streamlined stack organization
   - Enhanced error handling and logging
   - Improved security with IAM roles and policies

## Current Focus
