# SiteChat Product Context

## Problem Statement
Organizations need an efficient way to help users find and understand information from their websites. Traditional search functions and navigation can be cumbersome and may not always lead users to the exact information they need. Users often prefer conversational interfaces that can understand their questions in natural language and provide relevant, contextual responses.

## Solution Overview
SiteChat provides a conversational AI interface that allows users to interact with website content naturally. Instead of browsing through multiple pages or using keyword searches, users can ask questions in their own words and receive relevant, contextualized answers derived from the website's content.

## Core Value Propositions
1. **Natural Interaction**: Users can ask questions in plain language
2. **Contextual Understanding**: Responses consider the full context of the website content
3. **Immediate Access**: Quick, relevant answers without manual searching
4. **Flexible Integration**: Works with different LLM providers and can be adapted for various websites

## User Experience Goals

- **Simplicity**: Clean, intuitive interface with minimal learning curve
- **Responsiveness**: Real-time message updates and smooth interactions
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear distinction between user and assistant messages
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation flow within the session

### Interaction Patterns
1. **Initial Engagement**
   - Welcome message introduces the chatbot's capabilities
   - Clear prompt placeholder guides users on how to ask questions
